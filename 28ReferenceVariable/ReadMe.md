NOTES: 
1:---->
*Pass By Value Function
when we use pass by value function copy of the variable will be created in the function. 
changes will be pllied on copy variable only. changes won't be applied on original value. 

*Pass By Reference function
here we pass reference variable. and the changes done on reference variable reflects on main function variable

*funct function: 
it is a bad practice ro return a reference variable. 

*fun cunction;
it is also a bad practice
